            </div>
            <div>A stock market crash is a rapid and often unanticipated drop in stock prices. A stock market crash can
                be a side effect of a major catastrophic event, economic crisis, or the collapse of a long-term
                speculative bubble. Reactionary public panic about a stock market crash can also be a major contributor
                to it, inducing panic selling that depresses prices even further.</div>
            <div>Famous stock market crashes include those during the 1929 Great Depression, Black Monday of 1987, the
                2001 dotcom bubble burst, the 2008 financial crisis, and during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.</div>
